# Session progress table

Owner reporting rule installed 2026-10-19. Update this table after every session, then copy it into both the session closeout and the final reply. Keep the columns and baseline row order stable so successive reports are easy to compare. Always keep full Syzygy parity last, even when adding detail above it.

Current mathematical evidence: through S074. Thirty-nine theorem bundles are frozen, including the clock-free KRK forcing classification; these are not thirty-six solved material classes.

| Endgames / target | Progress | Remaining |
|---|---|---|
| K vs K | Draw proved and frozen | — |
| K+B vs K | Draw proved and frozen | — |
| K+N vs K | Draw proved and frozen | — |
| K+R vs K | Dead/live and clock-free forcing frozen; raw history/rule prerequisites frozen; conditional budget lifting formally verified; 508-ply bound frozen; key-simple strategy and conditional 84-ply RAW wall family frozen; sharper 73-ply framed wall and global 442/443 ceilings formally verified | Concrete FIDE integration, complete rule-aware outcomes and distance |
| K+Q vs K | Open in this project | General proof and formal verification |
| K+P vs K | Open in this project | General proof and formal verification |
| All four-piece endgames | Open in this project | Every material class and legal position |
| All five-piece endgames | Open in this project | Every material class and legal position |
| All six-piece endgames | Open in this project | Every material class and legal position |
| All seven-piece endgames | Open in this project | Every material class and legal position |
| **Full Syzygy parity (through seven pieces)** | **Open** | **Complete class coverage, 50-move WDL and DTZ parity** |

Session change: S074 formally verified actual parametric setup and global 442-ply strong-arrival/443-ply weak-winning ceilings; the partial RAW 73 clock≤26 family is unchanged, full FIDE/class outcomes remain open and 39 bundles remain frozen.

Piece counts include both kings. The four- through seven-piece rows include all material classes at each size, including mixed material and promotions; they are not claims of completed work. Add individual class rows above their aggregate as work begins, retaining the aggregate rows and the final parity row.

“Formally verified” means Gate F passed; it does not mean frozen. A proved forcing family does not establish the outcome of every position in that class. Full Syzygy parity means proof-based coverage without consulting tablebases, with the relevant 50-move outcome (WDL) and distance-to-zeroing (DTZ) semantics. The base kernel omits clocks/repetition history; additive raw traces and a counter are frozen, while complete history adjudication and distance results remain open. Do not infer percentages from the number of frozen theorem bundles.
